# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive check of the MB Construction website to ensure all components are functioning properly.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want to verify that all static assets load correctly, so that the website displays with proper styling and functionality.

3. WHEN images are displayed THEN all image sources SHALL load correctly or have appropriate fallbacks
4. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN Google Fonts SHALL display correctly
5. WHEN animations are triggered THEN CSS animations and JavaScript animations SHALL work smoothly
6. IF any static assets fail to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix any configuration issues, so that the development and production environments work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are checked THEN all required configuration SHALL be present and valid
2. WHEN dependencies are verified THEN all npm packages SHALL be installed and up to date
3. WHEN the database connection is tested THEN MongoDB SHALL be accessible and properly configured
4. WHEN security configurations are reviewed THEN JWT secrets, CORS settings, and rate limiting SHALL be properly configured
5. WHEN file paths are verified THEN all referenced files SHALL exist in the correct locations
6. IF configuration issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want all interactive features to work properly, so that I can successfully contact the company and navigate the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want to verify that error handling works correctly, so that users receive helpful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid API requests are made THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the frontend SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN form validation fails THEN specific field errors SHALL be highlighted and explained
