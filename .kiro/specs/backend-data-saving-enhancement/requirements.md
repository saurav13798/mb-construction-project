# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of data saving functionality in the MB Construction backend system. The current system has basic CRUD operations for contacts and projects, but lacks advanced data persistence features, comprehensive validation, automated backups, data integrity checks, and performance optimizations. This enhancement will improve data reliability, system performance, and provide better data management capabilities for the construction company's operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated data backup and recovery mechanisms, so that critical business data is protected against loss and can be restored quickly in case of system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs daily at 2 AM THEN it SHALL automatically create a complete database backup
2. WHEN a backup operation completes THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and log the results
3. WHEN backup storage exceeds 30 days THEN the system SHALL automatically purge old backups while retaining weekly and monthly snapshots
4. WHEN a restore operation is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate backup file integrity before proceeding
5. WHEN backup operations fail THEN the system SHALL send notifications to administrators and retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced data validation and sanitization mechanisms, so that only clean, valid data is stored in the database and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is submitted to any endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate all fields according to defined schemas
2. WHEN invalid data is detected THEN the system SHALL return detailed validation errors with field-specific messages
3. WHEN text data is received THEN the system SHALL sanitize input to prevent XSS and injection attacks
4. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and scan for malicious content
5. WHEN data relationships exist THEN the system SHALL enforce referential integrity constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want bulk data operations and import/export capabilities, so that I can efficiently manage large datasets and integrate with external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bulk contact import is requested THEN the system SHALL process CSV/Excel files with validation and error reporting
2. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking and detailed results
3. WHEN data export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate files in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
4. WHEN bulk updates are made THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails of all changes
5. WHEN import errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports with line-by-line feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive audit logging and data versioning, so that all data changes are tracked and can be reviewed for compliance and debugging purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data modification occurs THEN the system SHALL log the change with user, timestamp, and old/new values
2. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL create detailed audit entries with IP addresses and user agents
3. WHEN data is deleted THEN the system SHALL implement soft deletion with recovery capabilities
4. WHEN audit logs are queried THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities
5. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate audit trails for specified date ranges

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized database performance and caching mechanisms, so that data operations are fast and the system can handle increased load efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate indexes for optimal performance
2. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the system SHALL serve from cache when possible
3. WHEN cache invalidation is needed THEN the system SHALL update cached data automatically
4. WHEN database connections are managed THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and monitoring
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track query times and identify slow operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business user, I want advanced search and filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly find specific records and generate meaningful reports from the stored data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search queries are submitted THEN the system SHALL support full-text search across multiple fields
2. WHEN complex filters are applied THEN the system SHALL support date ranges, multiple criteria, and sorting options
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms and provide relevance scoring
4. WHEN large result sets exist THEN the system SHALL implement efficient pagination with cursor-based navigation
5. WHEN saved searches are created THEN the system SHALL allow users to store and reuse complex filter combinations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want data synchronization and replication capabilities, so that data consistency is maintained across multiple environments and backup systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL replicate changes to designated backup databases
2. WHEN synchronization conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL implement conflict resolution strategies
3. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync pending changes
4. WHEN replication lag is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and attempt recovery
5. WHEN data integrity checks run THEN the system SHALL verify consistency between primary and replica databases
