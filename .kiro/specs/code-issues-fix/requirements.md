# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for identifying and fixing code issues in the MB Construction website project. The project is a full-stack web application with a Node.js/Express backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend. Based on the analysis, several security, configuration, and code quality issues need to be addressed to improve the project's reliability, security, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Configuration Issues

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to have proper security configurations, so that the system is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JWT_SECRET is configured THEN it SHALL be at least 32 characters long for proper security
2. WHEN email credentials are configured THEN they SHALL not use placeholder values in production
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate all security configurations before proceeding
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which variables need to be set

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and Logging Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any part of the application THEN it SHALL be properly caught and logged with context
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users while logging detailed errors for developers
3. WHEN API endpoints encounter errors THEN they SHALL return consistent error response formats
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log all critical configuration information for debugging

### Requirement 3: Code Quality and Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code quality standards across the project, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all console.error statements SHALL be properly formatted and consistent
2. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL follow consistent patterns across all modules
3. WHEN environment validation occurs THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive feedback about configuration status
4. WHEN the application handles file operations THEN it SHALL include proper error handling for file system operations

### Requirement 4: Database Connection Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable database connections with proper error handling, so that the application can gracefully handle database issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN database operations timeout THEN the system SHALL handle the timeout gracefully
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate user feedback
4. WHEN database connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect without manual intervention

### Requirement 5: Frontend Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the frontend SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL inform users about the connection problem
3. WHEN form submissions fail THEN the system SHALL preserve user input and show specific error details
4. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and logged without breaking the user experience

### Requirement 6: Configuration Validation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive configuration validation, so that misconfigurations are caught early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate all required and optional environment variables
2. WHEN configuration values are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on correct values
3. WHEN email configuration is incomplete THEN the system SHALL warn about reduced functionality
4. WHEN file upload limits are misconfigured THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log warnings
