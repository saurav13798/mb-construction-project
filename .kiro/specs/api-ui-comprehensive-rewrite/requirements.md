# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive rewrite of the backend API system and frontend user interface to create a modern, beautiful, and highly functional web application. The project will modernize the existing MB Construction website with enhanced API architecture, improved database connections, and stunning CSS animations and visual effects that provide an exceptional user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modern API Architecture Rewrite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a completely rewritten backend API system with modern architecture patterns, so that the application is more maintainable, scalable, and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is rewritten THEN the system SHALL implement RESTful API design principles with proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide consistent JSON response formats with proper error handling
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use modern connection pooling and transaction management
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization middleware
5. WHEN the API is deployed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive input validation and sanitization
6. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and security headers

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Database Connectivity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want improved database connections and data management, so that the application performs efficiently and handles data reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling for optimal performance
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. WHEN data is queried THEN the system SHALL implement efficient indexing and query optimization
4. WHEN transactions are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure ACID compliance and data integrity
5. WHEN the database is accessed THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection timeout and retry logic

### Requirement 3: Beautiful Frontend Animations and Effects

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to experience beautiful animations and visual effects, so that the website feels modern, engaging, and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL display smooth entrance animations for content elements
2. WHEN users interact with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide satisfying hover and click animations
3. WHEN users scroll through content THEN the system SHALL implement parallax effects and scroll-triggered animations
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL show loading animations and success/error feedback
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide smooth page transitions and micro-interactions
6. WHEN content appears THEN the system SHALL use staggered animations for lists and card elements

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the website to look beautiful and function perfectly, so that I have an optimal experience regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts with smooth responsive animations
2. WHEN screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adjust layouts gracefully with transition effects
3. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch feedback and gestures
4. WHEN the viewport resizes THEN the system SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and readability

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want fast loading times and smooth interactions, so that I don't experience delays or janky animations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are triggered THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance using hardware acceleration
2. WHEN assets load THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading and progressive enhancement
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL provide loading states and optimistic updates
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient compression and modern formats
5. WHEN CSS animations run THEN the system SHALL use transform and opacity properties for optimal performance

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Inquiry Form System

**User Story:** As a potential client, I want a seamless inquiry form experience with real-time validation and beautiful animations, so that I can easily submit my project requirements and receive prompt responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the inquiry form loads THEN the system SHALL display animated form fields with floating labels and smooth transitions
2. WHEN users type in form fields THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation with animated feedback messages
3. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight errors with smooth color transitions and helpful messaging
4. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL show loading animations and success/error states with beautiful transitions
5. WHEN form data is processed THEN the backend SHALL implement comprehensive validation, sanitization, and secure database storage
6. WHEN inquiries are received THEN the system SHALL provide admin dashboard integration with real-time notifications and status management

### Requirement 7: Modern UI Components

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the website, I want modern, intuitive UI components, so that the interface feels contemporary and easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL include floating labels and validation animations
2. WHEN buttons are presented THEN the system SHALL implement gradient effects and shadow animations
3. WHEN cards are shown THEN the system SHALL include hover effects and depth animations
4. WHEN modals appear THEN the system SHALL use backdrop blur and smooth scale transitions
5. WHEN navigation is used THEN the system SHALL provide animated menu transitions and active states
